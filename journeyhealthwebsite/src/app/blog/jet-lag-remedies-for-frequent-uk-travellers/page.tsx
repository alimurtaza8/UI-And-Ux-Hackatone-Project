    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-10 mb-5">What jet lag means for you</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Jet lag is a temporary sleep disturbance. It affects people who travel across multiple time zones in a short period. Your body clock struggles to adjust.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      This shift can lead to daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep, and poor mental focus. Many UK travellers experience these problems when they fly for holidays or business.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      The NHS states that jet lag usually improves after a few days. That process can take longer if you cross many time zones or head east. Timely support and guidance are essential.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Why travel east feels tougher</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Experts explain that traveling east shortens your day. This means your circadian rhythms receive less time to reset. You may feel extra fatigued or find it even harder to get restorative sleep.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Shifting your body clock forward is the challenge. Your system prefers to extend its wake cycle, not shorten it. Eastbound flights can force the body into a new schedule too rapidly.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      When you head east from the UK, you will likely face earlier sunrise times. That adds further confusion to your natural sleep-wake cycle. Good planning helps.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">The role of light in jet lag</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Natural light is a major signal for your internal clock. Bright morning light can reset your sleep cycle and reduce fatigue. On the other hand, exposure to bright evening light might delay sleep.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Many UK travellers try to get outside soon after arrival. This approach aligns the body with local daylight patterns. It can ease the transition to a new time zone.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Avoid bright screens late at night. That step might support better melatonin production. Small changes in your bedtime routine can make big differences.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Adjust your schedule before you fly</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Some people shift their bedtime by 30 minutes each day in the week before departure. This gentle approach can reduce the shock of a sudden time change.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Try to move your meal times closer to those in your destination. By adjusting your internal clock in small steps, you might experience milder jet lag symptoms.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Plan flights that arrive in daylight hours if possible. That allows natural sunlight to guide your system to a more suitable rhythm. Every small step can help.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Stay hydrated during long flights</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Studies from trusted travel health sources advise drinking plenty of water in flight. Dehydration can worsen fatigue. It can also intensify headaches and sluggishness.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Opt for non-alcoholic and decaffeinated drinks when possible. Alcohol and caffeine can disrupt sleep quality and leave you feeling more restless. Hydration supports clearer thinking and better mood.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Keep sipping water at regular intervals. Adjusting to the plane&apos;s lower humidity level protects you from the drain of dry cabin air. Your body will thank you.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Move around when possible</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Frequent walks along the aisle can boost circulation. Light stretching helps your body cope with cramped seating. These actions may reduce soreness and tension.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Simple leg or foot exercises can keep your blood flowing well. Some travellers use compression socks for added support. Physical movement also helps you stay awake when you need to reset your schedule.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Consult a medical professional if you have specific circulation concerns. Journey Health can guide you if you have questions about long-haul travel.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Short-term medication options</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Melatonin is a hormone that regulates your sleep cycle. A short course of Melatonin 2mg XL is sometimes recommended for jet lag relief. This approach can help reset your body clock quickly.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Research from public health authorities shows melatonin may lessen the time it takes to fall asleep. It can also improve overall sleep quality after crossing time zones.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Melatonin 2mg XL tablets release the hormone in a controlled manner. Always follow medical advice and avoid overuse. Safe usage can ease your transition into a new routine.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">How Journey Health supports you</h2>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Tips for minimising jet lag impact</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Try to eat light meals once you land. Heavy, late-evening meals can disrupt your delicate body clock. Lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables can supply steady energy.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Exposure to fresh air and gentle exercise can promote alertness. Walking, yoga, or simple stretches can help your mind and muscles recover from the flight.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Limit daytime naps upon arrival. A brief nap might help if you feel completely drained, but long naps may complicate your new sleep schedule.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Citing official NHS guidance</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      NHS resources suggest that melatonin can be an option for adults with severe symptoms. While jet lag often resolves naturally, relief strategies can quicken your adjustment.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      NHS advice also supports good sleep hygiene practices. These include avoiding large amounts of caffeine, turning off bright lights, and setting a regular bedtime. Consistency is key.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Speak to our pharmacists if you need further clarification on any official guidelines. Patient education is part of our mission.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">When to seek extra support</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Prolonged jet lag can impact mental alertness and work performance. If symptoms last longer than a week or include severe mood changes, consult a healthcare professional.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">A final word on jet lag prevention</h2>

      Your schedule might be busy, yet simple strategies can add up to big relief. Try to plan each trip with a focus on healthy routines and gradual body clock shifts.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Keep your momentum going by engaging in local time activities right away. This might involve an early walk, a balanced meal, or a relaxing evening wind-down.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Trust professional advice if you need medical interventions. Always ensure you follow dosage guidelines and consider potential interactions with other medications.
    </p>
