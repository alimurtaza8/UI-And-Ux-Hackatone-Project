    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-10 mb-5">Premature Ejaculation: An Overview</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Premature ejaculation is a common men’s health concern that affects many UK residents. It can create stress and affect self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Journey Health offers a discreet online service for those seeking solutions at home. This guide outlines key treatments.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      NHS guidelines suggest that stress or anxiety can trigger early release. Hormonal factors may also play a role.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Possible Causes</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Premature ejaculation can stem from psychological factors. Stress at work or in relationships often increases tension.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Physical issues include hormonal imbalances or underlying conditions. Your GP may conduct tests to rule out other concerns.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Some individuals notice heightened sensitivity. This can be influenced by reduced serotonin levels. A doctor can diagnose this through examination.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Common Treatment Methods</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Research from the NHS indicates that counselling or therapy can help many men. Couples therapy can also ease emotional stress.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Topical anaesthetic creams are sometimes prescribed. They numb the area slightly to reduce sensitivity, helping delay climax.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Oral treatments such as Priligy 30mg or 60mg may address serotonin pathways. They aim to extend the time before ejaculation occurs.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Psychological methods often focus on relaxation techniques and direct communication with a partner to reduce performance anxiety.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Prescription Options</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Priligy 30mg and Priligy 60mg contain dapoxetine, designed to delay ejaculation by acting on specific brain chemicals. Men usually take Priligy a few hours before intercourse. A GP or pharmacist can guide you on the best schedule.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Possible side effects include dizziness, headache, or nausea. These often decrease after several uses. Always read the patient leaflet.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Local anaesthetic creams or sprays can be used instead of tablets. This route can minimise systemic effects while delaying sensitivity.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Stud 100 Delay Spray</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Stud 100 delay spray contains lidocaine. It numbs the penis slightly to extend the period before climax. Application should occur several minutes before intercourse, and the area should be washed afterwards to prevent numbness for a partner.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Check for skin reactions or irritation. If redness appears, consider pausing use. Seek professional advice if symptoms persist.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Communication and Intimacy</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Speaking openly with your partner can reduce pressure. Let them know how you feel. This may lessen anxiety around sexual performance.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Exploring new pacing methods can help. Some find the stop-start technique useful, while others practise pelvic floor exercises.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Relaxation strategies like deep breathing or massage can encourage calm, fostering better control.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Journey Health’s Discreet Services</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Journey Health provides confidential online consultations for premature ejaculation. You can speak to professionals from home to recommend Priligy, Stud 100, or other approaches based on your medical profile.

    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Online deliveries arrive in discreet packaging, preserving your privacy. Reliable shipping ensures you can begin treatment promptly.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Support continues after you receive medication. Clinicians can address side effects or dosage queries, keeping you informed throughout.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Lifestyle Tips for Better Control</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Reducing alcohol intake may improve sexual stamina, as alcohol can affect your ability to maintain control.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Regular exercise, such as brisk walks, boosts circulation and overall health, supporting better erectile function.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      A balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein provides energy and may enhance physical endurance.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Sleeping well contributes to hormonal balance. Fatigue can aggravate premature ejaculation, so adequate rest promotes resilience and focus.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Seeking Professional Help</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Speak with a GP or pharmacist if difficulties continue. They can investigate underlying conditions or prescribe suitable medication.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Mental health support, such as CBT, may ease psychological barriers contributing to early release.
