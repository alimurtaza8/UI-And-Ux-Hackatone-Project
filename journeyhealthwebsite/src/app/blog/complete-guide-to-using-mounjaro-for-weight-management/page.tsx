    <h2 className="text-3xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-10 mb-5">Mounjaro for Steady Weight Management</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Mounjaro is a medication designed to support people who want steady weight management. It belongs to a class of medicines known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which can influence how your body regulates hunger and glucose levels.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      This guide explains why Mounjaro may help you reach your goals. It also covers helpful habits, potential side effects, and insights from official sources like the NHS and MHRA.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">How Mounjaro Works</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic a hormone that helps regulate appetite and blood sugar. Mounjaro encourages slower digestion of food, so you may feel satisfied with smaller meals.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Better appetite control often leads to reduced calorie intake. A lower calorie intake can then support weight loss over time. As noted by the NHS, consistent progress may require regular medical guidance.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Optimal Dosage and Timeline</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Mounjaro is usually prescribed at a lower dose to begin with. Your clinician may adjust the amount based on your response. Journey Health can offer personalised support, monitoring your progress through convenient online consultations.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Timeframes for results vary. Some people notice improvements within a few weeks, while others need more time. Steady and sustainable changes are often reported, which aligns with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Complementary Habits for Success</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Portion control is a key strategy. By choosing smaller plates and avoiding second helpings, you may reduce overall calorie intake. This practical approach can work well with Mounjaro.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Gentle exercise, such as brisk walks or simple home workouts, can further boost your results. Physical activity may help improve cardiovascular health and mood, making weight management more achievable.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can enhance your progress. These foods offer vital nutrients and keep you full without excessive calories.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Potential Side Effects</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Mounjaro may cause mild nausea, digestive discomfort, or fatigue in some cases. These effects often lessen as your body adapts. If you experience any severe reaction, speak with a healthcare professional.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      According to MHRA reports, side effects can vary from person to person. Monitoring your condition helps ensure any issues are addressed promptly. Journey Health offers professional guidance tailored to your situation.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Blood Sugar Monitoring</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Mounjaro may also support healthy blood sugar levels. Checking your readings at home can help track improvements.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Use a reliable glucose meter if recommended by your clinician. Keep a record of daily levels to spot any fluctuations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">When to Seek Advice</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Seek advice if side effects persist or become severe. Signs of an allergic reaction, such as swelling or difficulty breathing, need immediate attention.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Regular check-ins can help track any emerging complications. Early intervention often leads to better outcomes, which aligns with MHRA recommendations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Journey Health’s Weight Loss Support</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Journey Health offers a comprehensive weight loss program featuring Mounjaro. You can consult qualified clinicians and receive guidance from home, ideal for those with demanding schedules.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Online services allow for regular follow-ups without frequent trips to a clinic. This saves time and ensures you stay on track with professional advice always available.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Practical Tips at Home</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Plan meals by writing a weekly menu of balanced options and shopping accordingly to avoid impulse purchases.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Keep an activity log: track daily steps or minutes of movement, and celebrate small wins like an extra five minutes of walking.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Staying hydrated supports digestion and can reduce unnecessary snacking.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Maintaining Progress</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Track your weight and measurements to see gradual changes and spot patterns that guide routine adjustments.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Seek motivation from family or friends by sharing goals for a supportive environment, and reach out to Journey Health for encouragement.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
      Emotional well-being can influence eating habits. If stress or anxiety arises, speaking with a therapist may help support consistent progress.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semi-bold text-black mt-12 mb-5">Next Steps</h2>
    <p className="mb-5 text-gray-800">
